I'm a first year undergraduate student from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interest includes AI4Math, Formal Reasoning and LLM Safety.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sirui Han](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=sirui-han-siruihan) and [Prof. Yike Guo](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yike-guo-yikeguo).
