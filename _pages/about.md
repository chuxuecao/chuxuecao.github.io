I am a first-year PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interests include AI for Mathematics (AI4Math), Formal Reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) Safety.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sirui Han](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=sirui-han-siruihan) and [Prof. Yike Guo](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yike-guo-yikeguo).
